## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS for mobile menu and slider animation


### What I learned

I learned, that I need to verify some new properties of CSS in caniuse.com :). I used things like 
`code` grid-template-columns: subgrid; `code` or `code`padding-inline: 1rem;`code` etc. So later I realized that this only works in firefox, but not in chrome or safari.

Next I learned about "transitionend" in javascript, which wait for CSS animation and do the code after it finish. This was really helpful in my slider section.


### Continued development

I know, that I need more exercise from JS. I made the slider with tutorial. I understand all the parts, but I cannot write the code alone. 


### Useful resources

- [Tutorial from Weibenfalk on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AuH3xSo6f8) - This helped me for with my slider. First I started build the code alone, but I could not figure out, how the "transitionend" works
- [Caniuse.org](https://caniuse.org) - If I used this earlier, it wouldn't spend so much time on this challenge.
